abstract = {<p style="text-align: justify;">We propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to
solve an optimization problem stemming from inverse lithography. The objective
functional of the optimization problem includes three terms: the misfit between the
imaging on wafer and the target pattern, the penalty term which ensures the mask is
binary and the total variation regularization term. By variable splitting, we introduce
an augmented Lagrangian for the original objective functional. In the framework of
ADMM method, the optimization problem is divided into several subproblems. Each
of the subproblems can be solved efficiently. We give the convergence analysis of the
proposed method. Specially, instead of solving the subproblem concerning sigmoid,
we solve directly the threshold truncation imaging function which can be solved
analytically. We also provide many numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness
of the method.</p>},

title = {Solving inverse obstacle scattering problem with latent surface representations},
journal = {Inverse Problems},
abstract = {We propose a novel iterative numerical method to solve the three-dimensional inverse obstacle scattering problem of recovering the shape of an obstacle from far-field measurements. To address the inherent ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, we advocate the use of a trained latent representation of surfaces as the generative prior. This prior enjoys excellent expressivity within the given class of shapes, and meanwhile, the latent dimensionality is low, which greatly facilitates the computation. Thus, the admissible manifold of surfaces is realistic and the resulting optimization problem is less ill-posed. We employ the shape derivative to evolve the latent surface representation, by minimizing the loss, and we provide a local convergence analysis of a gradient descent type algorithm to a stationary point of the loss. We present several numerical examples, including also backscattered and phaseless data, to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
