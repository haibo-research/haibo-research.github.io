## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Tsinghua University with an interest in developing innovative computational methods for solving challenging inverse problems in imaging. My research focuses on applying optimization-based and learning-based methods to solve inverse problems in imaging, particularly optical imaging, scattering imaging, and medical imaging, with special emphasis on three-dimensional reconstruction, shape design, and surface generation.

## Research Interests

## Research Statement

My research on inverse obstacle scattering problems introduces a novel approach using implicit surface representations to reconstruct unknown object shapes from scattered field measurements. This representation framework enables flexible modeling of complex geometries without explicit parameterization, significantly improving our ability to recover objects with intricate shapes and topological variations.

In my work on inverse lithography problems, I developed an efficient ADMM-based algorithm that addresses the challenge of determining optimal mask patterns in semiconductor manufacturing. The method introduces a novel problem decomposition strategy that transforms complex optimization problems into efficiently solvable subproblems.

My research program aims to advance both the theoretical understanding and practical applications of inverse problems in imaging, with particular focus on computational efficiency, accuracy, and real-world applicability. By integrating techniques from optimization, numerical analysis, and machine learning, I seek to develop innovative approaches to challenging inverse problems across scientific and engineering disciplines.
